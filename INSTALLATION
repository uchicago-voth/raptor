Installation
------------

1. RAPTOR is a plugin package to LAMMPS for running MS-RMD simulations. To run
   LAMMPS/RAPTOR, the first step is to download, configure and install LAMMPS
   distribute from its official website.

   * LAMMPS website:  https://lammps.sandia.gov/
   * Download link:   https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html
   * Official manual: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html

   A recommended version can be download directly via:

   * https://lammps.sandia.gov/tars/lammps-3Nov2022.tar.gz

   A quick installation guide can be found at:

   * https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Build_make.html

   User needs to configure the Makefile by providing customized system library
   dependencies. Following dependencies are required for building LAMMPS with
   the RAPTOR package:

   * MPI (IntelMPI or OpenMPI)
   * FFT (Intel/MKL or FFTW3)

   To use RAPTOR, following two LAMMPS packages need to be enabled:

   * MOLECULE
   * KSPACE

2. When the LAMMPS instance is installed with PLUMED patch, an additional `make yes-PLUMED` is required. _After_ the LAMMPS with patched with PLUMED, two files, `fix_plumed.cpp` and `fix_plumed.h` need to be patched as well. This patch ensure correct interface between RAPTOR and PLUMED, namely:
- The CEC can be accessed through additional virtual atoms in PLUMED
- The bias force can be correctly treated by RAPTOR
If this patch is not installed automatically, please manually merge the two files in colvars to your LAMMPS installation.

3. Here's an example of commands that can be used to build LAMMPS with RAPTOR:

   ```
   cd [LAMMPS]/src
   cp -rp [INSTALL]/USER-RAPTOR .
   make yes-MOLECULE
   make yes-KSPACE
   make yes-USER-RAPTOR
   make mpi
   ```

   Explanation:

   * [LAMMPS] is the folder from unpacking the downloaded LAMMPS tar file
   * [INSTALL] is this folder that from unpacking VOTH-RAPTOR.tar.gz tar file
   * If everything runs successfully, an executable binary filewill be 
     generated as [LAMMPS]/src/lmp_mpi
   * Note, there was an example Makefile in previous release, but it is not
     provided anymore because of the compatibility issue after `C++17` being
     used in LAMMPS. Default Makefile.mpi provided by LAMMPS is directly
     usable for RAPTOR.
 
Tests and Usage
---------------

There are two examples provided in the `tests` folder in this package:

   * single - Water box with one pair of H+ and CL-
   * multi  - Water box with 16 pairs of H+ and CL- (using MS-RMD-SCI method)

Both of them are using the newest RMD/3.2 parameters for excess protons in
water. To run any of these test, run following command in the folder:

   ```
   mpirun -np [N] [LAMMPS]/src/lmp_mpi -in in.lmp
   ```

   * [N] is the number of processes (cores) to run the simulation
   * [LAMMPS] is the folder of LAMMPS distribute
